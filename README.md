## Description
This repository contains the KinBot code version 2.0,
a tool for automatically searching for reactions on the potential energy surface.

## How to Install
Make sure all dependencies are correctly installed (see the manual in the docs/ directory for a list of dependencies). 

Clone the project on your machine and go into the KinBot/ directory. Run the following:

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install
    
Alternatively, you can also install the latest stable version (however, this is behind compared to what is on GitHub, so currently the github installation is preferred) using conda:

    conda install -c rdkit -c openbabel -c zadorlab kinbot


## How to Run
To run KinBot (which will only explore one well), make an input file (e.g. input.json) and run:

    kinbot input.json

To run a full PES search, make an input file (e.g. input.json) and run:

    pes input.json

You can find additional command line arguments in the manual.
